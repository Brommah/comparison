[Our platform](https://www.databricks.com/product/develop-your-agent)

### Ground your AI agent

Imbue your agent with your company's identity, policies, processes, and knowledge – ensuring your agent represents the best of your business.

Chat example showcasing how an AI agent can be customized with a knowledge base, integration, customer information and a company's personality

### Solve problems the right way

Set goals to guide your agent to the right solutions, and set guardrails to ensure they stay on-point and aligned with your policies.

Customizable skills to choose from for the AI agent such as triage, workflow, search and confirm

### Take action on your systems

Conversational AI isn't just about answering questions. With Sierra, your AI agent can take action, whether updating a case in CRM or managing a delivery in an order management system.

## Safe and secure

Sierra is designed with the highest commitment to trust, security, and compliance. Your AI agent won't pretend to be something it's not, and it will be honest about its limitations.

### Supervision

Guardrails ensure your agent stays on-topic, and real-time monitoring tracks live interactions.

Conversational chat showing someone asking a yoga studio's AI agent for a cake recipe and the AI agent responding politely that they can't help with that request

### Secure integration

AI may be flexible, but security standards should not be. When AI accesses your systems of record, those interactions are deterministic and controlled to ensure your AI always follows your policies and security procedures.

### Auditing

Built-in quality assurance workflows ensure your customer experience team can understand the reasoning behind every AI interaction.

### Data governance

Your data is only used for your company's agent. We don't use your data to train models, and we use industry standard best practices to ensure your data is secure.

Product mock up showcasing multiple chats being securely stored

### Privacy

Personally identifiable information is automatically encrypted and masked.

[Our platform](https://sierra.ai/product/develop-your-agent)

### Ground your AI agent

Imbue your agent with your company's identity, policies, processes, and knowledge – ensuring your agent represents the best of your business.

Chat example showcasing how an AI agent can be customized with a knowledge base, integration, customer information and a company's personality

### Solve problems the right way

Set goals to guide your agent to the right solutions, and set guardrails to ensure they stay on-point and aligned with your policies.

Customizable skills to choose from for the AI agent such as triage, workflow, search and confirm

### Take action on your systems

Conversational AI isn't just about answering questions. With Sierra, your AI agent can take action, whether updating a case in CRM or managing a delivery in an order management system.

[Our platform](https://sierra.ai/product/develop-your-agent)

## Safe and secure

Sierra is designed with the highest commitment to trust, security, and compliance. Your AI agent won't pretend to be something it's not, and it will be honest about its limitations.

### Supervision

Guardrails ensure your agent stays on-topic, and real-time monitoring tracks live interactions.

### Secure integration

AI may be flexible, but security standards should not be. When AI accesses your systems of record, those interactions are deterministic and controlled to ensure your AI always follows your policies and security procedures.

### Auditing

Built-in quality assurance workflows ensure your customer experience team can understand the reasoning behind every AI interaction.

### Data governance

Your data is only used for your company's agent. We don't use your data to train models, and we use industry standard best practices to ensure your data is secure.

Product mock up showcasing multiple chats being securely stored

### Privacy

Personally identifiable information is automatically encrypted and masked.
